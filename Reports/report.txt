I think that feature engineering could help establish additional value using exploratory data analysis in this data set in two ways.
    1)  The ActSceneLine can could be separated into three separate columns: Act, Scene, and Line. By splitting this string column,
        which has the form X.X.X, you will no longer have to worry about special string formatting. Also, the values in between the
        periods (X in my example) are all integers, so instead of treating integers as strings, we can treat them as integers, which
        will make them easier to sort and could potentially make it easier to notice patterns when it comes time to begin data analysis.
    2)  The Dataline column can be eliminated. The Dataline column is just a counter for how many rows are in the data set. Since the
        number of rows, and moreover the specific number of a given row in the data, has no relation to what is contained in the row
        (or dataset), it should be removed so that it is not considered when performing exploratory data analysis. This will reduce the
        dimensionality of the data set to help with speed and memory management when working with the dataset. Also, pandas automatically
        keeps track of the number of rows/row number, so there is no reason to keep and/or include this column in the data set.
    3)  Add columns/labels for each of the players such that the data is numeric-binary. This will aid in classification since categorical
        data cannot be classified. It will also help in grouping and feature extraction of other data. For example, if a player's name
        is Hamlet, make a column IsHamlet, where the value will be 1 if the player is Hamlet, and 0 if it is not.
